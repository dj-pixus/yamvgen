# Yet Another Music Video Generator
This little script was written just to make producers' life a bit easier by partially automating the process of publishing music on video platforms.<br>It can (and will) generate a video from your sound file with the video being some background image with your song's title and artist name written on it with fancy letters and a minimalistic waveform display.<br>You can do some limited amount of customization with configuration profiles and command line arguments.

The script requires ImageMagick and FFmpeg to be installed.
